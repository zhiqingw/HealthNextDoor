This is the current version of our project. We are team HealthNextDoor,
 and we would like to solve the problem "how might we better support family caregivers 
 as they care for a loved one with dementia". We would like to use 
 this website to help Dementia patient and their families.
 
 ## Features
 
 For Deliverable 3, we just developed 3 main pages, which can 
 be seen from the web navigation, Home, Login, and Caregivers. 
 And we also develop two core functions.
 ### Core Function
 1. Login 
 
        a. When you click into Login page, you will see the Login
            box, you can use login button log into our web. 
    e.g. try username: jack, password: 1234
        
        b. If you are not our user, you can click sign up button 
            to sign up your account.
    e.g. try to enter any username and password by yourself
 
        c. After you login or signup, page will link to your user
            center, which will display your post recording. 
    e.g. try username: jack, password: 1234
    
        d. Also in your user center, you can change your password
            by click Reset Password button.
    e.g. try click and change it by yourself
    
 2. Caregivers
 
        a. When you click into Caregivers page, you will see the
            information list of our caregivers.
            
        b. You can also use the filter function, above the 
            caregiivers' information, to filter some conditions
            to find a caregivers who suits you best, also press
            back button to return to the full list page.
     e.g. click female condition, and press search, it will only 
        show female caregivers
        
        c. If you want to join the caregiver team, and show your 
            information on this page, you can click "Let's Join Us
            Today" button, and it will link to a new page with the 
            information form, and you can post your information. 
            After posting the information, you can get to the login 
            page to see your post.
